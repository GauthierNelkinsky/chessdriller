## Random future thoughts

* delay opponent moves slightly
* animation feedback on: correct/wrong move, variation done, entire variation correct
* keep W/B rep on the same study page, just distinguish them through board orientation. also force going through one color first, before switching to the other.
* pretend that there's no due moves if number of moves is <10 and another one will be due in a couple minutes
* identify leeches (keep count of lapses?)
* incorrect answer decreases move ease, but when to increase?
* undo button for pgn upload
