{ Hello and welcome to another opening study. Today I will guide you thourgh some underrated gambits against one of the most common openings, the Italian. On the way, I will show you some sneaky and effective traps. Please click the heart button, so I will be motivated to make more of these studies. I hope you will enjoy this and let's begin!

(By the way, all the haters will say these are beginner's traps and aren't effective, but a lot of White's moves are the most played move, and there is only one way for White to have any chances in the game)

EDIT: Thanks so much for 1400+❤️! I am really grateful to everyone! Let's keep going! }
