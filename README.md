# Chessdriller

## Hi!

[Chessdriller](https://chessdriller.org/) is an open-source app for spaced repetition of chess openings.
It's a free and libre alternative to the spaced-repetition features of Chessable, ChessTempo, Chessmadra, ChessHQ, Chess Position Trainer, Bookup, Listudy, etc.

To try Chessdriller out, just [log in with Lichess](https://chessdriller.org/join) to get started.
A Lichess account is needed since your repertoire is stored as Lichess studies.

This is a fully functional beta version.
You're very welcome to [email me](mailto:tim@gurka.se) about any issues, feedback or suggestions, or just to chat about chess.
Github issues and PRs are also welcome.

Cheers,<br/>
Tim
