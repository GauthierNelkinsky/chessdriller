# [Chessdriller](https://chessdriller.org/)

## Hi!

*Chessdriller* is an open-source app for spaced repetition of chess openings.
It's a free and libre alternative to the spaced-repetition features of Chessable, ChessTempo, Chessmadra, ChessHQ, Chess Position Trainer, Bookup, Listudy, etc.

I use this fully functional beta every day for my own chess practice.
If you'd like to try it out, just [log in with Lichess](https://chessdriller.org/join) to get started.
A Lichess account is needed since your repertoire is stored as Lichess studies.

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, bug reports, contributions or would just like to chat about chess or development,
you're very welcome to [shoot me an email](mailto:tim@gurka.se), open an issue or send a PR.

Cheers,<br/>
Tim
