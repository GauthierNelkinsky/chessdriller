# Hi!

*Chessdriller* is an open-source app for spaced repetition of chess openings. It's a free and open alternative to the spaced-repetition features of Chessable, ChessTempo, Chessmadra, ChessHQ, Chess Position Trainer, Bookup and Listudy.

Although I'm building Chessdriller for my own chess practice, it's fully functional. If you've been looking for something like this and would like to try it out, [please shoot me an email](mailto:tim@gurka.se?subject=Chessdriller).
