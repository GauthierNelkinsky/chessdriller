	<h1>Hi!</h1>
	<p>
		<b>Chessdriller</b> is an open-source app for spaced repetition training of chess openings.
		It's a free and libre alternative to the spaced-repetition features of Chessable, ChessTempo, Chessmadra, ChessHQ, Chess Position Trainer, Bookup, Listudy, etc.
	</p>
	<p>
		To try Chessdriller out, just <a href="/join">log in with Lichess</a> to get started.
		A Lichess account is needed since your repertoire is stored as Lichess studies.
	</p>

	<p>
		This is a fully functional beta version.
		You're very welcome to <a href="mailto:tim@gurka.se">email me</a> about any issues, feedback or suggestions, or just to chat about chess.
		<a href="https://github.com/gtim/chessdriller/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github issues</a> are also welcome.
	</p>
	<p>Cheers,<br/>
	Tim</p>
